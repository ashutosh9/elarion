In Elarion we are thinking of making the battles more strategic by adding alot of new features like :

-terrain bonuses ( bonus spell damage , resistance , speed )
-some caster mobs might have stronger spells that need more than 1 turn to cast (channels)
-cover command of some defensive units
-etc ...
